# Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
The **Heart Disease Prediction** project is a Python-based machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on key health parameters. Using advanced ML models, this project helps healthcare professionals and users quickly assess the risk of heart disease through an intuitive interface.

## Features
- Predict the risk of heart disease using ML models.
- User-friendly interface to input patient health data.
- Implements multiple ML algorithms for accurate prediction.
- Provides insights on prediction results for better understanding.
- Easy to extend with new datasets or additional models.

## - **Project Structure Components:**
  - `data/` : Contains CSV datasets used for training and testing the ML models.  
  - `models/` : Stores trained ML models for predictions.  
  - `notebooks/` : Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model experiments.  
  - `app.py` : Main application file to run the project (Flask/Streamlit app).  
  - `requirements.txt` : Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.  
  - `utils/` : Helper scripts for preprocessing, feature engineering, or utility functions.
